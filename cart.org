  ;;; Commentary:

  ;; cart.el provides convenient function definitions meant to be used
  ;; in tandem with auctex and some pdf viewer within Emacs (like
  ;; pdf-tools).  The main purpose is to speed up inserting and editing
  ;; graphical objects using Tikz/Pgf on latex documents/(beamer)
  ;; presentations.

  ;; So far there is support for inserting Tikz draw and
  ;; node objects, and conducting rigid body translations and
  ;; rotations on these objects.  The way to use this would be to first
  ;; calibrate the coordinate system by clicking on two points and
  ;; providing their coordinate values.  This allows the package to
  ;; establish the coordinate mapping between the pixel coordinates on
  ;; the frame to the Tikz/Pgf coordinates meant to be inputted.  The
  ;; relevant calibration variable is customizable.  So after a
  ;; particular calibration, if the user feels that the same view can be
  ;; used across sessions, then it may be saved in the customize
  ;; interface.  See more in the README.org file.
